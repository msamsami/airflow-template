## Introduction
Airflow is a Python-based workflow management tool for data engineering pipelines.
It simplifies the development, deployment, and monitoring of data pipelines by using
DAGs. Visit [Airflow documentations](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/index.html) for more information.

This is a template project to use Apache Airflow for scheduling and monitoring workflows.
It covers how DAGs and operators are defined, scheduled, and run using Airflow.
The deployment is also included using Docker Compose.
